Covid: What are the new rules for schools?
Children in England are now returning to school, after months of enforced home-schooling.

However, there will be some major changes to the normal school experience.

How will testing work in schools?
Students in England will be tested for Covid-19 three times in the first two weeks of school. After that they will be given two tests each week to use at home.

These will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat. The sample is then inserted into a tube of liquid and gives a result within 30 minutes.
